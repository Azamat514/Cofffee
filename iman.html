      <h2>Our commitment</h2>
      <p>
        We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy for you to 
        discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want 
        to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these 
        places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well 
        above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant 
        science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native 
        growing region.
